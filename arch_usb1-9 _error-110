I cannot figure out why I got this problem:
As the arch-linux is starting, it prints "usb 1-9 device descriptor read/64 error -110

I search on the Internet for the answer, yet not a quite one. It seems to have something to do with the motherboard and BIOS.
SO I tried to update the BIOS, yet finding no way on the AUSUS official website.

So I just restored the BIOS configurations to the default and shutdown the computer.
Then I started the computer again and configure the BIOS to turn off secure boot to boot my arch-linux. And that problem disappears.
Amazing and very happy.
